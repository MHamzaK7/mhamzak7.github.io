Gallery Slide Show:

I added multiple divs of class mySlides in a master class of container. The mySlides class contains the number of the image and the image element itself. I then added two anchor points which work as buttons to go prev and next the css was provided to me. I later coded the javascript part of it. In it I used an event listener of DOMContentLoaded to make sure the html runs first and then the javascript part. It then intilizes the first picture and then uses event listeners that listen for the prev and next click and move the images next and back depending on the input. The function uses indexes to move prev and next.

User Registration:
I added a new sign up navigator in the website that leads to a signup page which consists of the signup form made from the instructions provided to me. I used the same DOMContentLoaded to make sure the javascript runs after the html since it was causes errors saying the javascript is running before the html. It then uses EventListeners to take in the input for the user and runs the input through the functions which are for a certain input. The function follow really generic guidelines for username , email , password and confirm password. After the user has followed all the guidelines and put in the inputs correctly the user is able to press on the submit button which then checks if none of the errors are thrown up in the javascript file, after checking that and if everything passes it lets the user know that the sign up was successful.
